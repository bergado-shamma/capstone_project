# [ReservIT: Property and Facility Reservation System of PUP Taguig Campus](reservit.netlify.app/](https://reservit.netlify.app/index.html)

**An online platform designed to streamline and automate the reservation of campus property and facilities at Polytechnic University of the Philippines Taguig Campus.**

## Overview

ReservIT addresses the inefficiencies of the current manual reservation system at PUP Taguig Campus, which is prone to errors, delays, and scheduling conflicts. This system provides a web-based solution for students, faculty, property custodians, and administrative officers to easily view real-time availability, reserve campus properties and facilities (like chairs, tables, event equipment, gymnasium, and audio-visual rooms), and receive automated notifications. Our goal is to enhance campus operations, reduce errors, and improve the overall reservation experience.
